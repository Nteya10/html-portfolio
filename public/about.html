<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello world! My name is Denis Elima. I was born in Kinshasa, Congo, and I was raised in the United States of America.
  I am a citizen of the United States of America, and I love my country. My country is the greatest in the world. We are loving
  and caring people, and we put God first.

<p>I grew up in North Carolina. My favorite place to visit when I was young was my grandmother's house. She lived in New Jersey; she was the best and
  nothing was given from her because everything was earned. I loved it because it made me work. For example, in order to
  to get a gift, I had to do choirs around the house and keep the yard fresh. I was young and excited with full of joy; therefore, I loved 
  doing choir. Being around my grandparents made me into a fine adult because of how they disciplined me.

<p>Growing up, I love computers and soccer. When I was younger, I love sitting in front of a computer trying to learn something new. My favorite sports
  that I love playing growing up is Soccer and American Football. I use to practice whenever I can. One of my dream was to play professional soccer.
  My dream of being a professional came short. I had an illness, yet I didn't let that stop me from living life. It challenging but with my character trait
  perseverance, I keep on rolling and never giving up.
